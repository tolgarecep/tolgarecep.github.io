        <p><i>"I will call the attention of the crowd to their own ruination. And if they don’t want to see it willingly, I shall make them see it by fair means or foul.
            Please understand me — or, at least, do not misunderstand me. I do not intend to beat them… I will force them to beat me. Thus I actually compel them. For
            if they begin to beat me, they will probably pay attention; and if they kill me, they most definitely will pay attention, and I shall have won an absolute
            victory."</i></p>
            <p>&#8210; Kierkegaard, The Diary of Søren Kierkegaard</p>

        <p>Every human builds, to climb on and see further, further with each brick. We rise and see just as Newton depicted,
        "by standing on the shoulders of Giants". Construction of buildings are with care, and most beautiful ones always possess the power of collective care; care
        for science, philosophy, art; everlasting care to know. It is obvious* that the infrastructure buildings rise upon is culture. In a culture of doubt,
        science and philosophy rises. In a culture of passion and imagination, art rises. Valuable progress and pieces in these are products of the culture,
        that is shaped to produce such; the subject is never some individual that is abnormally bright by some unknown nature. Nature of the valuable phenomena is
        traceable, and the giant share of the cause belongs to the culture.</p>

        <p>The radical rogue in me believes, elimination of the mediocrity obstacle is just a matter of sufficient amount of pure work; go so
        deep into the unknown with the principles of the eternal nature, and you don't have to struggle through any kind compromise with any kind of dull.
        But, of course, compromise is necessary. With anyone, it means to align and dance for one or few projects, then the other might go up to the mountains
        and look for dragons. Compromise with bigotry has the same dynamic; the degree of alignment is the only difference. The coming together of similar
        minds is not enough, the space you're all in is full of authorities* that operate for different values. The hard compromise is between
        those who possess the intellectual honesty and morality and has big heart for the subject matter and those who operate on
        more worldy worries, or conventional wisdom.
            The sluggish nature of how *we* take position
            against reality, in other words what is our culture, has incoherencies that poison the soil under out feet which would otherwise
            rhymed with the minds above it. Communal, dominant culture is the aggregation of tools that are permitted as long as they're beneficial
            to easily-perceivable metrics. Bleeding edge of cultural progress is preserved in loneliness.</p>

        <p>When the chemicals align in a way that you like to go that one way but the water around you flows to the other; it is childishly exciting at first.
        Because you're not aware, or not very convinced that these differences have and will have giant impacts on your life, and you just go live on your
        buildings, say "Hi!" to your neighbors; but wait, they're kind of far away, aren't they? There is something wrong, you so sincerely have thought that this is the
        right place to build but most of the construction is so far away. You don't care, you walk that distance between at each compromise, continue to turn your
        face the other way from the obvious problem. Then you get tired, the potential utter loneliness is not a surprise to you, but you now got to deal with it since
        you have taken your fair share of gravity whenever you wanted to move upward. Then search for the tribe finally begins.</p>

        <p>You don't symphatize with the word "tribe" when you consider the psychological and cultural residuals of tribal life, but since <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2011/09/16/figure-out-whos-on-your-team/" target="_blank">this piece</a>
        uses it elegantly, I'm giving it another go. On the other hand, since we have to learn to live with this "tribal tendency", and nature really obliges you to have bias and set of assumptions, the morality has to be that
        we should be not soldiers, we can't be (and it is not functional to be) purely scouts, so we must be <i>soldiers of scouting</i>, that is,
        to not trust in a thing but in a process; which is many things in course of time.</p>

        <p>Here's the bottom line feeling we all should hold on to: there is no better life than to deal with things you care about, occasionally with people who care as much as you do. 
        This should capture all the necessary motivation in order to work on how to find cultures of people and institutions that align with yours, and finally, to build.</p>
