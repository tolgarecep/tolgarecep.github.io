  <h2>Camera as Ideology in 'The Zone of Interest (2023, Glazer)'</h2>
  <p>What stuck with me was the camera's insistence for looking at the flowers while all the violence is <br> happening
    in the background.
    This gesture of the camera is a manifestation of the <br> film's hypothesis on the catasthrophic phenomena. It's
    regardless of the psychology<br>of the characters and it has something to say about the universe. Ideology strives
    to function, but of <br>course,
    over time the worldview fails to stand up, as the pathetic morality of the <br>designed universe collapses and leaks
    are shown in the most shocking way in Glazer's<br> film.
    The film literally wears the ideology; it is the ideological look itself on <br>
    the daily life of the family. It gets tense, just like our own ideological lives, when the reality out there leaks through the ceiling and wall full of <br>
    ideas and presuppositions.
