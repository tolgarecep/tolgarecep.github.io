  <h2>Academic work</h2>
  <h3>TUBITAK granted (2247-C) research on Transformer-based Variational Autoencoders</h3>
  <p>We propose an alternative VAE architecture inspired by the inner workings of the ubiquitous Transformer. We
    also diagnose the condition of posterior collapse on the latent space and aggressively train the encoder to
    create an efficient model overcoming this. Finally the architecture is trained on a large Turkish corpora and
    tested on various tasks such as sentiment analysis and text classification. Publicly available <a
      href="github.com/tolgarecep/Transformer-VAE">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>Machine Learning and Differential Equations (Review)</h3>
  <p>Ongoing work about machine learning as a numerical method for solving DEs, and how their performance on this
    task opens up new horizons in applied mathematics, and internally, in rigorous machine learning.</p>
  <h2>Professional work</h2>
  <h3>Data Engineer</h3>
  <p>Integrating, consolidating and cleaning data and structuring it for analysis and modeling at Turkish Technic,
    the MRO of Turkish Airlines. Developing clustering, supervised and unsupervised learning solutions for
    component planning problems.</p>
