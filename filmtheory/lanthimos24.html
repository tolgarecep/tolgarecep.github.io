<h3>Disfunctional Imagery of "Kinds of Kindness (2024, Lanthimos)"</h3>
<p>
You want to talk about the power of control. When and where does it occur? There are many real cases. There are many organic materials you can turn to; not necessarily real because you must be realistic, but because after all, all we care about is something real. You could rearrange the organic reality to be a poetic fiction that evokes feelings, asks, begs, uplifts. We would be delighted. Or, you could take the components of the drama; after a little analysis, all there is to a story of a controlling relationship is someone empowered to control by a sense of narcissistic insecurity, and a similar other—except he knows of other, passive methods to do so. If you feel that what you've ended up with is not artistic, add some quirky costumes to the story, such that it is now shocking. You have a piece completely existent in its own imagery. Tarkovsky warns, this could be a complete work but it could also slip away from our orbit:

"There is a term which has already become commonplace: 'poetic cinema'. What is meant by it is cinema that boldly moves away, in its images, from what is factual and concrete, as pictured by real life, and at the same time affirms its own structural wholeness. But there is a hidden danger for cinema in moving away from itself. 'Poetic cinema' as a rule gives birth to symbols, allegories and other such figures—that is, to things that have nothing to do with the imagery natural to cinema." (Sculpting in Time, Andrei Tarkovsky, tr. Kitty Hunter-Blair)
