<h3>Camera as Ideology in "The Zone of Interest (2023, Glazer)"</h3>
<p>&emsp; &emsp; What stuck with me was the camera's insistence for looking at the flowers while all the violence is happening in the background. This gesture of the camera is a manifestation of the film's hypothesis on the catasthrophic phenomena. It's regardless of the psychology of the characters and it has something to say about the universe. Ideology strives to function, but of course, over time the worldview fails to stand up, as the pathetic morality of the designed universe collapses and leaks are shown in the most shocking way in Glazer's film. The film literally wears the ideology; it is the ideological look itself on the daily life of the family. It gets tense, just like our own ideological lives, when the reality out there leaks through the ceiling and wall full of ideas and presuppositions. </p>
