    <strong>integrated gradients (interpreting BERT)</strong><br>
<p>
<font size="-1"><p></p>
<p>Attribution methods attribute the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a model agnostic way of interpreting neural networks. Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks
    proposes two axioms that all attribution methods ought to satisfy, gives examples for previous work that do no satisfy these axioms and design a new method standing on these two
    axioms.</p>
<h3>Sensitivity</h3>
<p>An attribution method satisfies Sensitivity if for every input and baseline that differ in one feature but have different predictions then the differing feature should be given
    a non-zero attribution. Simply calculating the gradient of the output violates this property (this is analogous to the very basic interpretation of linear regression models,
    where the derivative w.r.t. a feature is the corresponding weight.) Here's an example: Consider the function below. We increase the only feature
    by 2 and the prediction changes from 0 to 1. The Sensitivity states that this feature must have a non-zero attribution.</p>

<img src="./imgs/sensitivity.jpg" alt="">
<p>As we can observe from the graph of the function, the gradient at x=1 is 0, thus the gradient method's attribution will be 0.</p>
<p>Why we want attribution methods to satisfy Sensitivity? First of all, it is quite intuitively a desired property, and practically, we want it because 
    the lack of sensitivity causes gradients to focus on irrelevant features.</p>
<h3>Implementation Invariance</h3>
<p>Implementation Invariance states that if two networks are functionally equivalent, no matter how they're implemented, then attributions made by the attribution method
    must be identical. This gives the method its model agnostic nature. Gradients are very familiarly independent of implementation; the chain rule for gradients, when you think of
    g and f as the input and output of the network, and h as the implementation, is implementation independent since the gradient of output f to input g can be computed directly. 
</p>
<img src="./imgs/chain.jpg" alt="">
<p>You can check the paper method examples that satisfy one while violating another, and the proposed method Integrated Gradients actually combines the properties of methods that
    satisfy one of the axioms. It combines the implementation invariance of the gradients and the sensitivity acquired by calculating discrete gradients in methods like LRP or DeepLift.
</p>
<p>The integrated gradient along the ith dimension for an input x and baseline x' is defined as follows. It is the path integral along the straightline path from x' to x, scaled by 
    the difference between two vectors.</p>
<img src="./imgs/ig.jpg" alt="">
<p>Then you cumulate these for all dimensions and it is equal to the function's output at the input x minus output at the baseline x'.</p>
<h3>Example: BERT Question Answering</h3>
<p>As our inputs while working on question answering with BERT are tokens, we will now attribute values to tokens and try to understand which parts of the input (question - text
    pair) the model focused on while generating the answer. You can check the implementation details at Captum's tutorial.
