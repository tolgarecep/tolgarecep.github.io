<h3>100 epochs</h3>
<p>It is true there were rumours going on amongst the natives of the interior of that continent, that some of the ships had sunk, and the ’50 Swede’”s death’s descent had come forward to inform me some time ago that a revolt was approaching. All this talk was just a pretence. And, as you may understand, Kurtz was ’till the sun went down, and the earth began to tremble anew, that, after all, was the monthning of all men, in every way including his own.’ I did not stir. I had no mind for such a revolt. The earth was stirring now. My dear boys, it is your turn now. I will shake hands with Kurtz once more, and shake hands with all the other captains of the day, on and on. The fires are up. I am off. The coast is clear. Rest easy.</p>

<p>“We exchanged a glance for a long moment, then he took hold of my arm. ‘I heard he had left for Africa very shortly,’ he said, a touch of tenderness in his voice. ‘It was not a very appealing thought,’ I said. ‘But those bushpeople wouldn’t talk,’ he added, with a suddenness. ‘He had a small lot of tuktult at his disposal,’ I said. He looked at me with an air of hesitation. ‘Hm’hile’ Well, I have got nothing to say. What do you think I ought to do? Eh? What do you think I ought to do? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! I had become very lonely. I had not had the time to read the news, and I had not the time to write to Mr. Kurtz yet. I don’t want any harm to happen to myself or to my acquaintances if I continue to go out there. Eh? I had rather be alone than have confidential men take me into their veins. I rather think that what I had been privately touching than meet the man whom they had educated and respected in the street than sit by and watch the affair for the purpose of talking about. . . Nobody should see the mistake in it; I rather fear I would get caught in it if I tried. But I was not much for talk. .’</p>

<p>‘The wilderness,’ he said, ‘is the home of horrors.’ The poor devil would not sleep at night. He blew on his lamp at once, and the lantern afresh in a hurry. ‘One of these days you will see the wilderness,’ he said. He crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to me, ‘He is very bad.’ ‘What can I do?’ I asked. ‘He can no doubt hear you,’ he said, with a laugh. ‘Everybody wants to hear you.’ I offered him a glass of water. He gave it up. ‘I don’t want to know anything about Mr. Kurtz,’ he said, looking at the sick man with interest. ‘Ah, he is frightful,’ he muttered, shakily. He crossed the room gently to look at the man with whom he had so nobly shared a room. He seemed to be gesticulating, and the old woman with her legs dangling over the flame. She looked at me with curious glance: effectually silent for an hour, then—‘take her for a romantic gesture—take her for a signboard in something—‘take her away from me altogether. Very neglected, very quiet. Perhaps you will think it alarmingly alarmed. ‘The suspicion is very, very great.’—she said, showing a wide berth, and led off in a leopard-print blouse, with the collar-gang flapped. Lights flicked in the cloudy night. A dark figure crouched on the bank, looking straight into my eye. Its flat surface was like an awash in mud on the riverside, and the streams flowed unrecognizablely darkly. Its limb was wild, its eyes wild, as if constricted, and its head slightly swollen. Its body was of a light blue to the very last, with an ungainly ring on its forehead. It waded matter leaped together like a tangled gingery tree, and its back was no more. Its sides had become rounder, and its lipollaides had grown white. Its lips had become narrower, and its eyes had become wide. It had a wart on one cheek, and all that remained of his surface was a luminous substance on the other. It was a beautiful gesture, but it was really a cruel joke. It represented truthlessness, that is, lacking proportion, in the portrayal of truthfulness in the outrages of others and in what is meant in the commonest moment of time.truthfulness in a sense like a packet of cigarettes—I mean in a sense of what you would expect a man to take pride in but actually have an indifferentative interest in a sudden and glaring loss. This was the very essence of what made us human: it was fearless, it was passionate, it was nasty, it was tempestuous, but it also had a meaning, which was not in the taking of a life, but in the taking of a pauper’s possession of a penny-a-pump.</p>
