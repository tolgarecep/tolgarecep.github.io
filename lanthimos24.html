  <h2>Disfunctional Imagery of 'Kinds of Kindness (2024, Lanthimos)'</h2>
  <p>You want to talk about the control power. When and where does it occur? Many real cases.
    Many organic material you can attain to; not necessarily real because you must be realistic,
    but because after all all we care would be something real. You could rearrange the organic
    reality to be a poetic fiction that envokes feelings, asks, begs, uplifts. We would be delighted.
    Or, you could take the components of the drama; after a little analysis all there is to a story of a
    controlling relationship is someone empowered to control by a sense of narcissistic insecurity,
    and a similar another  -except he knows of other, passive methods to do so. If you feel that
    what you're ended up with is not artistic, add some quirky costumes to the story,
    such that it is now shocking. You have piece completely existent in its own imagery. Tarkovsky
    warns, this could be a complete work but it could also slip away from our orbit: <br>
    "There is a term which has already become commonplace: 'poetic
    cinema'. What is meant by it is cinema that boldly moves away, in its
    images, from what is factual and concrete, as pictured by real life,
    and at the same time affirms its own structural wholeness. But there
    is a hidden danger for cinema in moving away from itself. 'Poetic
    cinema' as a rule gives birth to symbols, allegories and other such
    figuresâ€”that is, to things that have nothing to do with the imagery
    natural to cinema." (Sculpting in Time, Andrei Tarkovksy, tr. Kitty Hunter-Blair)
