  <h2>The Embalmed Sorrow in 'Anora (2024, Baker)'</h2>
Towards the end, awareness comes into play, or something happens and the flow of life is rethought; in general in Baker's cinema.
Thanks to this inclination of the director Anora is a good film. This time, though, there is a more eventful film and the screenplay
tries to get through this by the methods of Zola and Uncut Gems. No need for a better formation of this similar action, but that it
turns out barely in tempo here is disappointing. This was not the case before and in his previous films characters and their surroundings
were revealed in subtle details. Finally the film arrives at the "awareness" part and that was the part that made the film.
With the snow a Ceylan-esque questioning embalms the film; we are left with its forever sorrow.
